We may only collect this information with your authorization in accordance with your device operating system's permission process.

**Information We Collect From Other Sources**

We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information, profile picture, phone number, email address, gender, date of birth and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.

Additionally, information that you provide in your account registration for a forum and your forum comments may be available to other forum users.
*   In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;
*   If we believe your actions are inconsistent with the spirit or language of our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of Fifth Journey or others;
*   In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company; or

### Social Sharing Features

The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook "Like" button), which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa. The use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.

### Analytics, Advertising and Other Services Provided by Other Companies

We may allow third parties to serve advertisements in connection with our Services, to provide analytics services and provide you with other services, such as rewards programs and tournaments. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, your account information (that you set up with these third parties) and other technologies to collect information about you on our Services and other websites and online services, such as your IP addresses, identifiers associated with your mobile device or applications on the device, the browsers you use to visit our Services, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked, and conversion information. These third parties may also share this information with their customers and clients. This information may be used by Fifth Journey, and these other companies and their customers and clients, to analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests, and better understand your usage. Some of these third-party analytics and advertising services offer you a choice to opt out of the collection of and/or sharing of this information; links to the opt-out mechanisms for the third parties that offer such a choice can be found in the "Your Choices" section below. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, third-party cookies, web beacons, or other tracking technologies.

### Security

Fifth Journey takes commercially reasonable security measures to help protect information Fifth Journey collects about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.  These security measures may include practices such as keeping your sensitive data on a secured server behind a firewall, transmitting sensitive information (such as a credit card number) entered while using our Services using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store your information.  Unfortunately, however, no security system can be 100% secured, and we cannot guarantee that communications between you and Fifth Journey and the Services, or any information provided to us in connection with the information we collect through the Services will be free from unauthorized access by third parties.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.  Your password is an important component of our security system.  As such, it is your responsibility to protect it.  Do not share your password with any third parties.  If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should change it immediately.

### Location of Data Storage

Fifth Journey stores information about site visitors and players on servers primarily located in Hong Kong, and Fifth Journey may also store such information on servers and equipment in other countries. If you are accessing the Services from outside of Hong Kong, please know the data and personal information you submit may be transferred to and stored in servers in Hong Kong or other countries. The data protection and other laws of Hong Kong and/or other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By submitting your data and/or using our Services, you consent to the transfer, storing, and processing of your data in and to Hong Kong and other countries were we may choose to store data.

Personal data collected within Switzerland and the European Economic Area ("EEA") may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of Switzerland and the European Economic Area ("EEA"). The data we hold may also be processed by employees operating outside of Switzerland and the EEA who work for us or one of our affiliates or for one of our vendors. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, (i) the processing of transactions and your payment details and (ii) the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, using the Services and/ or playing Fifth Journey games, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.

Parents who believe that Fifth Journey might have any information from or about a child under 13, may submit a request to [privacy@fifth-journey.com](mailto:privacy@fifth-journey.com) or write to: Fifth Journey, Attn:  Privacy Policy Administrator, 16/F, Cornwall House, Taikoo Place, Hong Kong and request that the information be removed.

### Modifications to This Privacy Policy

From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy to clarify our practices or to reflect new or different privacy practices, such as when we add new features, and Fifth Journey reserves the right to modify and/or make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any material change we will notify you by prominent means such as by email notice sent to the email address specified in your account or by posting a notice on [www.Fifth-Journey.com](http://www.Fifth-Journey.com). Modifications will become effective on the day they are posted unless stated otherwise.

Any notifications regarding changes that have been posted on [www.Fifth-Journey.com](http://www.Fifth-Journey.com) may be removed after 30 days.

If you continue to access and/or use the Services, including any of the Services available through any Third Party Platform, after the effective date of any change, then such access and/or use will be deemed an acceptance of and an agreement to follow and be bound by the Privacy Policy as changed. The revised Privacy Policy supersedes all previous privacy policies.

### Your Choices

**Cookies**

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.

### How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals

Because consumers are often unaware that their do-not-track beacons are active, do-not-track does not frequently reflect the actual preferences of our users.  Accordingly, Fifth Journey does not respond to the federal Do-Not-Track signal.  If you would like to receive no promotional communication from Fifth Journey, you are free to follow the procedure described in the previous section to unsubscribe.

### California Residents:  Your California Privacy Rights

Under California law, California residents who have an established business relationship with Fifth Journey or one of its subsidiaries may choose to opt out of Fifth Journey disclosure of personal information about them to third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you choose to opt-out, email [privacy@fifth-journey.com](mailto:privacy@fifth-journey.com) or write to: Fifth Journey, Attn:  Privacy Policy Administrator, 16/F, Cornwall House, Taikoo Place, Hong Kong.
